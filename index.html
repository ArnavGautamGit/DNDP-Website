        <h1> ABOUT THE SHOW</h1>
        <h4>A podcast where the host (Arnav) discusses Formula One and Formula E. 
          He gives his opinions on the race, predictions for the next race, and ALL the drama, 
          controversy, and fan-rage that happened that weekend with a pinch of comedy here and there. 
          Tune in on Sundays - even on race weekends (episodes live under 4 hours after each race - 
          except races in North/South America.

          <h1> ABOUT THE WEBSITE </h1>
          <h4>This Website, originally intended as a merchandise store is for now, just an official website 
            for Drag And Downforce Podcast (also called DNDP) for short. The initial plan was to only sell
            some stickers that one could stick anywhere - laptops, fridges, backpacks, desks... 
            You name it, there was a place you can stick them. Simple and Versatile. But because the Podcast is 
            at such a nascent stage right now, it was impractical. I will however allow you to donate through this website
            using BAT crypto tokens (Basic Attention Tokens).
            <br>
            BAT - made famous by Brave Browser is a token that is somewhere around 0.5 to 1.2 USD depending upon market rate 
            and is a great utility token. I have verified this website with Brave Creators and will be able to receive BAT from 
            people who use the Brave Browser. Sometime in the future, I might even leave a QR code to my crypto wallet as well
            to faciitate more direct transactions without having Brave as the middleman. 
            <br> 
            Each BAT counts. Thank You.
